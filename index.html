        <h2>Intro to kegging</h2>
            <p>Kegging is the process of loading your beer or cider into kegs after fermentation
                in order to carbonate without leaving the yeast alive.  In bottling, the yeast will
                continue eating the sugar after bottling, which creates carbonation.  However getting
                this process right is fairly hard.  Too much fermentation in the bottle will cause
                explosions because of the pressure.  Too little fermentation in the bottle will result
                in a sour taste.  Kegging is the superior method of consuming your craft beer or cider.</p>

        <h2>Pin-lock or ball-lock</h2>
            <p>The type of keg you use is really a personal choice.  You'll find that ball lock kegs
                are less available and more expensive, but there's no good reason for this to be so.
                I use pin-lock kegs and they were not only cheaper, but easier to find as well.  The
                bottom line is that it is up to you.  Be sure to check around for the best deals too!</p>

        <h2>Getting down to business</h2>
        <p>The first thing you're going to want to do is use the Starsan to clean the sanitize your kegs.
            It's important that your kegs are free of any bacteria or yeast that may change the flavor profile of your
            brew.  Mix an ounces of Starsan with a gallon of tap water and shake it around in your keg.  After two
            minutes, your keg will be sanitized and ready to go.  Dip your hands in the liquid, just to be safe.  Use a
            short length of tube to siphon from your primary (or secondary) fermentation into your keg.  Add some
            potassium sorbate to make sure the fermentation has stopped.  Hook it up to your CO2 cylinder and
            pressurize to at least 30 PSI.  After a few days, turn your CO2 regulator down to 20 PSI.  A few days after
            that, you can go ahead and set it to serving pressure.  Ta-da!  You have successfully kegged and carbonated
            your homebrew!</p>
