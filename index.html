<article id="intro">
    <p>Kegging is the process of loading your beer or cider into kegs after fermentation
        in order to carbonate without leaving the yeast alive.  In bottling, the yeast will
        continue eating the sugar after bottling, which creates carbonation.  However getting
        this process right is fairly hard.  Too much fermentation in the bottle will cause
        explosions because of the pressure.  Too little fermentation in the bottle will result
        in a sour taste.  Kegging is the superior method of consuming your craft beer or cider.</p>

<h2>Pin-lock or ball-lock</h2>
<article id="kegtype">
    <p>The type of keg you use is really a personal choice.  You'll find that ball lock kegs
        are less available and more expensive, but there's no good reason for this to be so.
        I use pin-lock kegs and they were not only cheaper, but easier to find as well.  The
        bottom line is that it is up to you!
